### License exception
Additional permission under GNU GPL version 3, section 7.

As a special exception, the copyright holder of this library grants you permission to link this library with independent modules to create a closed-source combined work, regardless of the license terms of those independent modules, and to copy and distribute the combined work under terms of your choice, provided that you also comply with the license terms of each linked independent module. An independent module is a module that is not derived from or based on this library.

**The application of this exception is subject to the following conditions:**
* The application of this exception is free of charge in the case of non-commercial use.
* In case of commercial use the application of this exception requires you to pay a fee to the copyright holder. Commercial use means that profit may be generated in the course of distribution of a combined work beyond mere cost recovery.

**The following modification exceptions apply:**
* Modifications of this library itself must remain open-source in case of non-commercial distribution of a combined work.
* In case of commercial use the source-code of a modified version of this library may or may not be published in the course of distributing a combined work. It is however not allowed to redistribute modified closed-source versions of just this library, outside of the scope of combined work.

This license exception is valid, even if the terms of the GPL are violated. If you publish the source-code of modified versions of this library, you are obliged to remove this exception from the terms of your version of the library, as you yourself become the copyright holder of your changes (see the contributions section below).
