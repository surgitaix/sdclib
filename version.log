- SDCProvider and SDCConsumer network bindings are separately configurable


Update to version 3.0.1 D10_2017_10_05_rev2:

- Portable to Windows systems, mind that xerces and xsd header files and xerces .lib files must be downloaded seperately
- Compilable / Runnable with Visual Studio 2013 (tested with XSD 4.0), Visual Studio 2015, Visual Studio 2017 (tested  with XSD 4.0, used msvcr120.dll from VS13, via CMake integrated in VS17)

- State handlers are templated now. Old API state handler classes deleted. 		
- Use e.g. SDCProviderMDStateHandler<NumericMetricState> / SDCConsumerMDStateHandler<NumericMetricState> instead.
- Unified state handlers: No multistate handlers anymore. Multistates are also handled by SDCConsumerEventHandler. Use one handler per state and / or define a state handler for the descriptor that comprises all the multiple context state
